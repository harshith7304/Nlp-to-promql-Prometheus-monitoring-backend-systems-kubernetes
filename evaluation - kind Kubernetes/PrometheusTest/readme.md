# Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Deployment Status Report



## Issue Summary

During the deployment, it was observed that some Prometheus targets are in a "down" state. This means that Prometheus is unable to scrape metrics from these targets. Consequently, the data collected and reflected in the `tested_promql_title.csv` file is incomplete, as it only contains data from the targets that are currently "up."

### Key Objectives
1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Provision a Kind cluster  
   - Deploy Prometheus and OpenTelemetry demo via Helm  

2. **Automated Testing**  
   - Use `test_promql.py` to read queries from `extended_test_queries.csv`  
   - Skip empty or malformed queries  
   - Validate each PromQL query against Prometheus and record results  

3. **Teardown & Cleanup**  
   - Delete the Kind cluster  
   - Uninstall Helm releases and remove Helm repositories  
   - Prune Docker resources and remove Kubernetes config  
   - Remove the Python virtual environment  

### Process Summary

- **Setup**:  
  - Kind cluster creation  
  - Helm-based deployment of monitoring and telemetry stacks  

- **Testing**:  
  - Python script execution against `http://localhost:9090`  
  - Generation of a results CSV with pass/fail status per query  

- **Cleanup**:  
  - Full teardown of cluster, Helm, Docker, and local environments  

### Future Enhancements
- Parallelize query execution for faster benchmarking  
- Extend the script to support additional monitoring backends  
- Add detailed performance metrics and visualization dashboards
